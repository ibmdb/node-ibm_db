 *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\par

 *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\par
 *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\par

 *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\par
 *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\par
 *          as modifying the License.\par
 *\par
 *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\par
 *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\par
 *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\par
 *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\par

 *      License.\par
 *\par
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\par
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\par
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\par
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\par
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\par
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\par

 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\par
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\par
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\par

 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\par
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\par
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\par
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\par
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\par
 *\par
 *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
